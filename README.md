# Merits

[Schoolbox](https://schoolbox.education/) does not support fetching achievements from their API intended for end-users. This inconvenience can be bypassed by using the JSON data that is served to web browsers when viewing achievements for a class/student.

This project can pull achievement data from the correct URL (see .env.example) and parse it, as well as fetching more detailed information about each recipient of an achievement, finally outputting all data into CSV format.
